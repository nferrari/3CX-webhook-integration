Goal of this 3CX integration is to make a HTTP request to an endpoint whenever a call is received on 3CX.

Configure your endpoint on 3CX:

* Go to 3CX administration panel: Admin > Integrations > CRM > + Add Template
* Configure your webhook URL

And voil√†! Your endpoint will receive a HTTP request with the caller number for every call.
